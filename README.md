This app is currently in development. Contributions are welcome.
If you would like to assist with field extraction, please view the [Field Extraction Register](https://github.com/satiex/splunk_synology_TA/blob/main/synology_TA_field_register.csv). More Log messages will be added as I discover them.

# Synology DSM Technical Add-on for Splunk

## Configuration
### Splunk

#### Receiving syslogs on Splunk
NOTE: We recommend that you forward logs from Synology to a dedicated Syslog server (rsyslog, syslog-ng) which will then forward the logs to Splunk.
- Configure a new Data Input using a UDP/TCP port such as 514 pointing to the new index using the "synology" sourcetype.

### Synology DSM
- Install the Log Center package from the Package Center.
- Configure the Log Sending settings.
  - Server: IP or hostname of Splunk Indexer, Splunk Heavy Forwarder, or your Syslog server which then forwards logs to Splunk.

## Support
Please file bug reports to our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/satiex/splunk_synology_TA/issues) and they will be addressed as soon as possible.

## TODO
- Synology DSM has a lot of featuers and functionality. I have not yet explored every possible action or event that generates a log. If you would like to contribute, please test as much of the different features of your Synology DSM and work on the field extractions for each event.
- I'm currently attempting to get file sizes into a consistant format (Bytes). I've started a post in the Splunk Community forums here: https://community.splunk.com/t5/Splunk-Search/Converting-variable-File-Size-Units-with-dot-points-to-bytes/m-p/567504
- The regular expressions for much of the field extractions needs tightening up.
